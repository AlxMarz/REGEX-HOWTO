# Understanding REGEX or Regular ExpressionsðŸŽ‰  (replace with your title)

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)
Welcome, this is a markdown created with the purpose of how regular expressions or REGEX work and why they are important to programmers. 


## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.
A regular expression is a search pattern used to look through a string of text. A way REXGEX
can be useful is validation, find and replace or simply filters for text that can be tweaked to be specialized or general. Regular expressions use literals which can simply be put as the characters found on your keyboard and Meta characters which are combinations of characters that define the search criteria. REGEX can be very useful to search and filter thought strings of text, in the markdown you will find out how and why there are so important.

## quick notes
REGEX is a type of search pattern using literal chareters and meta characters. Literal characters are literal numbers or straight up the characters found on your keyboard, while meta characters 
are literal characters used in combo to mean something or value something else ex- 
    META characters
\d can mean any number 0-9
\w is any letter A-Z, a-z, 0-9
\s is any white space(space or a tab, line break)
. is a wildcard, gets all 
\W anything thats not a word character 

    Quantifiers 
* 0 or more
+ 1 or more 

The characters ^ and $ are both considered to be anchors
